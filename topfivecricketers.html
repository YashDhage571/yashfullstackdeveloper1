    <p>Virat Kohli was born
        on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked
        as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an
        older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at
        Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a
        mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to
        him.[11

    <p>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
        cricketer
        and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional
        medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic
        cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[4] He holds the record as the
        highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international
        cricket.[5] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the
        list
        of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket
        World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times

    <p>Yuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played
        his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. In a
        match against England at the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart
        Broad[4] — a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an
        international match between two teams with Test match status. In the same match, he set the record for the
        fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls, which was a
        record for fastest half century in International cricket, until it was broken by Dipendra Airee during 2023
        Asian Games but Singh still holds the record in the ICC Cricket World Cup and among ICC full member nations.
        During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World
        Cup match. During the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh played eight innings in nine matches and scored 362 runs with
        a remarkable average of 90.50.[5] He also took 15 wickets in the tournament, maintaining an economy rate of
        5.02.[6]</p>

    <p>Yuvraj Singh (born 12 December 1981) is a former Indian international cricketer who played in all formats of the
        game. He is an all-rounder who batted left-handed in the middle order and bowled slow left-arm orthodox . He has
        won 7 Player of the Series awards in ODI cricket, which is joint 3rd highest by an Indian, shared with former
        Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. He is also the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor Yograj
        Singh.[3]</p>

    <p>Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ⓘ; pronounced [sətɕin teːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an
        Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of
        the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] Hailed as the world's most prolific batsman of all time, he
        is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs,
        respectively.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most player of the match awards in international
        cricket.[6] Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by presidential nomination from 2012 to

        Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for over
        24 years.[9] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all
        time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[10] The same
        year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later
        in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six
        World Cup appearances for India.[11] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World
        Cup.</p>
