    <p style="color: white;font-size: larger;"><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
            aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and
            raised
            in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the
            next
            four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the
            Missile
            Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He
            also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998,
            the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]</b></p>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: larger;"><b>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
            Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6]
            he
            returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
            recipient
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
            apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
            attended
            the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]</b>

    <h2 style="color: white;"><b>02. Nikola Tesla </b></h2>

        height="300px" width="300px">
    <p style="color: white ; font-size: larger;"><b>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/;[2] Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла, [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7
            January 1943) was a Serbian-American[3][4] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist.
            He
            is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
            system.[5]

            Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without
            receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at
            Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he
            became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before
            he
            struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories
            and
            companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and
            related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of
            money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</b></p>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: larger;"> <b>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
            mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
            wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
            demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
            showmanship
            at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide
            wireless
            electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado
            Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.
            Tesla
            tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental
            wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</b></p>

            majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s,
            along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak</b></p>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: larger;"><b>obs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before
            withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying
            Zen
            Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
            computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II,
            one of
            the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox
            Alto in
            1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the
            unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced
            computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the
            Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript</b></p>

            Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one
            of
            the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] Hailed as the world's most prolific batsman of all time,
            he
            is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs,

            Satya (1998) and made his directorial debut with Paanch, which never had a theatrical release due to
            censorship issues. He then went on to direct Black Friday (2004), a film based on the namesake book by
            Hussain Zaidi about the 1993 Bombay bombings. Its release was held up for two years by the District Board of
            Film Certification because of the pending verdict of the case at that time but was released in 2007 to
            widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's follow-up, No Smoking (2007) met with negative reviews and
            performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture Dev.D (2009), a modern adaptation of Devdas received
            positive reviews and was a commercial success; followed by the socio-political drama Gulaal (2009), and the
            thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011).</b></p>
    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger;"><b>Kashyap's prominence increased with the two-part crime drama, Gangs of Wasseypur (2012). Kashyap subsequently
            co-produced the critically acclaimed drama The Lunchbox (2013), and the biographical drama Shahid (2012),
            the former earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language nomination. His next films
            were the anthology Bombay Talkies (2013), and the drama Ugly (2014). In 2016, Kashyap directed Raman Raghav
            2.0, a film inspired by the serial killer Raman Raghav. His next film was the sports drama Mukkabaaz, which
            was released in 2018. The same year, he co-directed India's first Netflix Original series, the crime
            thriller Sacred Games, based on Vikram Chandra's novel of the same name and the romantic drama Manmarziyaan.
