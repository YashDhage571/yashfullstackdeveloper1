<h3>
    <p>In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com in a garage in Seattle, shortly after he resigned from the hedge fund
        giant D.E. Shaw. He had originally pitched the idea of an online bookstore to his former boss David E. Shaw,
        who wasn’t interested.
        18
        19 Bezos originally took Amazon public in 1997 and went on to become the first man since Bill Gates in 1999 to
        achieve a net worth of more than $100 billion. Bezos’ other projects include aerospace company Blue Origin, The
        Washington Post (which he purchased in 2013), and the 10,000-year clock—also known as the Long Now.

        On July 20, 2021, Bezos, his brother Mark, aviation pioneer Wally Funk, and Dutch student Oliver Daemen
        completed Blue Origin's first successful crewed flight, reaching an altitude of more than 66 miles before
        landing safely. Bezos' wealth peaked at $213 billion in the same month.

    <P>hough Amazon originally started out selling books, it has since morphed into a one-stop shop for everything
        under the sun and is expected to overtake Walmart as the world’s largest retailer by 2024. Amazon's pattern
        of constant diversification is evident in some of its unexpected expansions, which include acquiring Whole
        Foods in 2017 and entering the pharmacy business the same year. Bezos was born in Albuquerque and raised in
        Houston and Miami. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and
        computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded
        Amazon in mid-1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and
        has since expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming,
        cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is the world's largest online sales company, the largest
        Internet company by revenue, and the largest provider of virtual assistants and cloud infrastructure services
        through its Amazon Web Services branch.

<h3>
    <p><b>An engineer by training, Arnault first showed his business acumen while working for his father’s construction
            firm,
            Ferret-Savinel, taking charge of the company in 1971. He converted Ferret-Savinel to a real estate company
            named
            Férinel Inc. in 1979.7

            Arnault remained Férinel's chair for another six years, until he acquired and reorganized luxury goods maker
            Financière Agache in 1984, eventually selling all its holdings other than Christian Dior and Le Bon Marché.
            He was
            invited to invest in LVMH in 1987 and became the majority shareholder, chair of the board, and CEO of the
            company
            two years later.8

    <p>Arnault's entry into the luxury goods market was marked by his strategic acquisition of the
        financially-struggling textile and retail conglomerate Boussac Saint-Frères in 1984, which included the
        prestigious fashion house Christian Dior. His aggressive business strategies earned him the nickname "The
        Terminator," as he revitalized Dior and sold off other assets for profit. In 1987, he played a key role in the
        creation of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), a global company in luxury goods, by merging Louis Vuitton with
        Moët Hennessy. Through a series of strategic acquisitions and investments, Arnault changed LVMH into a major
        company in the luxury industry, overseeing significant growth and expansion into various sectors, including
        fashion, jewelry, watches, and wine.

        Arnault's influence extends beyond LVMH, with investments in web companies and philanthropic endeavors,
        particularly in the arts. He has been involved in notable real estate and yacht ventures. His leadership has led
        to LVMH becoming the largest company by market capitalization in the eurozone. Despite controversies, including
        his attempt to become a Belgian citizen, Arnault's business acumen have solidified his status as a key figure in
        the global luxury market.</p>

<h3>
    <p><b>Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and investor known for his key roles in space
            company SpaceX and automotive company Tesla, Inc. Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., formerly
            Twitter, and his role in the founding of The Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink and OpenAI. He is one of the
            wealthiest people in the world; as of June 2024, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$210 billion.[4]

            Musk was born in Pretoria, a member of the South African Musk family, and briefly attended the University of
            Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two
            years later, he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the
            University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California
            in
            1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded
            online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That
            same
            year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In October
            2002,
            eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk
            founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.

        </b></p>
    <p><b>In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.).
            He
            became the company's chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk
            helped
            create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In
            2013, he
            proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit
            artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology
            company developing brain–computer interfaces—and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018,
            the
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had
            secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of
            Tesla
            and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the
            company
            into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded
            xAI,
            an artificial intelligence company.

            Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[5] He has been criticized for making
            unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and endorsing antisemitic
            conspiracy
            theories.[5][6][7][8] His ownership of Twitter has been similarly controversial, being marked by layoffs of
            large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation on the website,
            and
            changes to Twitter Blue verification.</b></p>

<h3>
    <p><b>Mark Elliot ¸(/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American businessman. He co-founded the social
            media service Facebook, along with his Harvard roommates in 2004, and its parent company Meta Platforms
            (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is chairman, chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.

            Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his
            roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Zuckerberg took the company
            public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2008, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made
            billionaire. He has since used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the establishment of the
            Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. His net worth as of June 13, 2024 is USD $176 billion, making him the fourth
            richest person in the world, behind Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault, and Jeff Bezos.[1]</b></p>

    <p><b> A film depicting Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with Facebook, The Social
            Network, was released in 2010 and won multiple Academy Awards. His prominence and fast rise in the
            technology industry has prompted political and legal attention. The founding of Facebook involved Zuckerberg
            in multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and ownership of the website as well as issues of user privacy.

            Early life and education
            Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen (née
            Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.[2][3] He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were
            raised in a Reform Jewish household[4] in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[5] His great-grandparents were emigrants
            from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[6] Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring
            to Phillips Exeter Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.[7][8]

    <p><b>Lawrence Edward Page[2][3][4] (born March 26, 1973) is an American businessman, computer scientist, and
            internet entrepreneur best known for co-founding Google with Sergey Brin.[2][5]

            Page was chief executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 when he stepped down in favor of Eric
            Schmidt, and then again from April 2011 until July 2015 when he became CEO of its newly formed parent
            organization Alphabet Inc.[6] He held that post until December 4, 2019, when he and Brin stepped down from
            all executive positions and day-to-day roles within the company. He remains an Alphabet board member,
            employee, and controlling shareholder.[7]

            Page has an estimated net worth of $156 billion as of June 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires
            Index, and $145.2 billion according to Forbes, making him the fifth-richest person in the world.[8][9] He
            has also invested in flying car startups Kitty Hawk and Opener.[10]</b></p>

    <p><b>Lawrence Edward Page was born on March 26, 1973,[20] in Lansing, Michigan.[21][22] His mother is Jewish;[23]
            his maternal grandfather later immigrated to Israel,[22] though Page's household while growing up was
            secular.[23][24] His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of
            Michigan. BBC reporter Will Smale described him as a "pioneer in computer science and artificial
            intelligence".[25] Page's paternal grandparents came from a Protestant background.[26][27] Page's father was
            a computer science professor at Michigan State University and his mother Gloria was an instructor in
            computer programming at Lyman Briggs College at the same institution.[28][25][29] Larry's parents divorced
            when he was eight years old, but he maintained a good relationship both with his mother Gloria and his
            father's long-term partner and MSU professor Joyce Wildenthal.[30]: ch. 2 

            When Larry Page was six years old, in 1979, his father brought home an Exidy Sorcerer computer, which Larry
            soon mastered and began using for schoolwork.[31]

            During an interview, Page recalled his childhood home "was usually a mess, with computers, science, and
            technology magazines and Popular Science magazines all over the place", an environment in which he immersed
            himself.[32] Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: "I
            remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines".[33] According to writer
            Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents "fostered
            creativity and invention". Page also played instruments and studied music composition while growing up. His
            parents sent him to music summer camp—Interlochen Arts Camp in Interlochen, Michigan, and Page has mentioned
            that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. "In some sense, I
            feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me". In an interview Page said that "In
            music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing" and that "If you think about it from a
            music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, it's got to happen in milliseconds,
            fractions of a second".[11]</b></p>

        <p><b>William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and
                writer best known for co-founding the software company Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen.
                During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
                president, and chief software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May
                2014.[a] He was a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.

                Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in
                Albuquerque,
                New Mexico. Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO
                in
                January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became
                chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were
                considered anti-competitive. In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role at Microsoft and
                full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his
                then-wife Melinda had established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in
                February
                2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March
                2020,
                Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts
                on

                English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[5] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on
                the

                grandfather

                younger
                sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey"
                (i.e.,
                three) because his father had the "II" suffix.[6][7] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle
                in a
                home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[8]

        <p><b>Sergey Mikhailovich Brin (Russian: Сергей Михайлович Брин; born August 21, 1973) is an American
                businessman and computer scientist known for co-founding Google with Larry Page. He was the president of
                Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., until stepping down from the role on December 3, 2019.[1] He and
                Page remain at Alphabet as co-founders, controlling shareholders, and board members. As of June 2024,
                Brin is the 7th-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $146 billion, according to
                the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes.[2][3]

                Brin immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of six. He earned his bachelor's
                degree at the University of Maryland, College Park, following in his father's and grandfather's
                footsteps by studying mathematics as well as computer science. After graduation, he enrolled in Stanford
                University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he built a web search
                engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and they discontinued their PhD studies to start up
                Google in Susan Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park.[4]</b></p>

        <p><b>Sergey Mikhailovich Brin was born on August 21, 1973, in Moscow in the Soviet Union,[5] to Russian Jewish
                parents,[6] Mikhail and Eugenia Brin, both graduates of Moscow State University (MSU).[7] His father is
                a retired mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother is a researcher at NASA's
                Goddard Space Flight Center.[8][9]

                The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's
                paternal grandmother.[8] In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw,
                Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate.[8] They formally applied for
                their exit visa in September 1978, and as a result, his father was "promptly fired". For related
                reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they
                were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for
                many refuseniks. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the
                country.[8]</b></p>

                        Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his
                        investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He
                        attended New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon pursued a
                        business career. He later began various business ventures and investment partnerships, including
