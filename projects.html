<p style="font-size: larger; color: white ;" ><b>The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab
        Emirates. It is the world's tallest structure. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a
        mile)
        and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa
        has
        been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing Taipei 101, the
        previous holder of that status.[3][4]</b></p>

<p style="font-size: larger; color: white;"><b>Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary
        structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of
        the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament.[5] The building was opened in 2010 as part of a
        new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use
        development.</b></p>

<p style="font-size: larger; color: white;"> <b>The Clock Towers (Arabic: أبراج الساعة, romanized: Abrāj al-Sāʿat, lit. 'Towers of the Clock', formerly known as
        Abraj Al Bait), is a government-owned complex of seven skyscraper hotels in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. These towers
        are a part of the King Abdulaziz Endowment Project that aims to modernize the city in catering to its pilgrims.
        The central hotel tower, which is the Makkah Clock Royal Tower, is the fourth-tallest building and sixth-tallest
        freestanding structure in the world.[5] The clock tower contains the Clock Tower Museum that occupies the top
        four floors of the tower.[6]</b></p>

<p style="font-size: larger; color: white;"><b>The building complex is 300 metres away from the world's largest mosque and Islam's most sacred site, the Great
        Mosque of Mecca.[7] The developer and contractor of the complex is the Saudi Binladin Group, the Kingdom's
        largest construction company.[4] It is the world's second most expensive building, with the total cost of
        construction totaling US$15 billion. The complex was built after the demolition of the Ajyad Fortress, the
        18th-century Ottoman citadel on top of a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque.[8] The destruction of the
        historically significant site in 2002 by the Saudi government sparked an outcry and a strong reaction from
        Turkey.[9][7]</b></p>

<p style="color: white;"><b>Merdeka 118, formerly known as Menara Warisan Merdeka,[a] KL 118 and PNB 118, is a 118-story megatall skyscraper
        in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At 678.9 m (2,227 ft) tall, it is the second-tallest building and structure in the
        world, only behind the Burj Khalifa at 828 m (2,717 ft).</b></p>

<p style="color: white;"><b>It is the tallest building in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. It surpassed the 453.6 m (1,488 ft) Exchange 106 to
        become the tallest building in Malaysia and surpassed the 461.2 m (1,513 ft) Landmark 81 to become the tallest
        building in Southeast Asia.[12] The building will also be the first in Malaysia to receive a triple platinum
        rating from worldwide sustainability certifications, including Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
        (LEED).[12]The building's name, Merdeka, which means "independence" in Malay, is inspired by its proximity to
        Stadium Merdeka.[10] The spire of the building was completed in December 2022, which marked its final height of
        678.9 m (2,227 ft) above ground and 700.9 m (2,300 ft) above sea level.[11]</b></p>

<h2 style="color: white;"><b>04. Tokyo Skytree.</b></h2>
<img src="https://parametric-architecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tokyo-Skytree.jpg" height="300px"
    width="300px">
<p style="font-size: larger ;color: white;"><b>Tokyo Skytree located in Tokyo (Japan) is the third-tallest skyscraper in the world and one of the world’s tallest
        free-standing towers. The tower consists of an exterior lattice coated in Skytree white paint. The structure
        consists of a central reinforced concrete column core encasing the emergency staircase and elevator shafts. The
        tower is a fusion of modern and traditional design (Neofuturistic design and traditional Japanese beauty). The
        structure is earthquake resistant, due to the presence of an integrated mass damper to reduce structural
        vibrations.
    </b></p>
<p style="font-size: larger; color: white;"><b>The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kantō region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer
        gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise
        buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May
        2012.[6] The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the
        complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree
        Station and nearby Oshiage Station. The complex is seven kilometres (4.3 miles) northeast of Tokyo Station.
        Sumida Aquarium is in the Tokyo Solamachi complex.</b></p>

<h2 style="color: white;"><b>05. Shanghai Tower.</b></h2>
<img src="https://parametric-architecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Shanghai-Tower.jpg" height="300px"
    width="300px">
<p style="font-size: larger;color: white;"><b>The Shanghai tower stands 127 stories high which is the tallest skyscraper in China and among the ten tallest
        structures in the world. It is a landmark and an icon in the financial and trade center of China. The skyscraper
        is a mixed-use structure with offices, hotels, cultural facilities, and observation decks. The twisting form of
        the building gives stability, which helps reduce the structural wind load on it. The structure consists of a
        thick concrete core rather than a steel girder framework as a structural skeleton. It displays stability and
        energy efficiency (Helps maintain internal energy/heat – Double layer glass façade).</b></p>

<p style="font-size: largerss; color: white;"><b>Shanghai Tower (Chinese: 上海中心大厦; pinyin: Shànghǎi Zhōngxīn Dàshà; Shanghainese: Zånhe Tsonsin Dusa; lit. 'Shanghai
        Center Building') is a 128-story, 632-meter-tall (2,073 ft) megatall skyscraper located in Lujiazui, Pudong,
        Shanghai.[10] It is the tallest building in China and the world's third-tallest building by height to
        architectural top. It is the tallest and largest LEED Platinum certified building in the world since 2015. It
        had the world's fastest elevators at a top speed of 20.5 meters per second (74 km/h; 46 mph) until 2017,[11][12]
        when it was surpassed by the Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, with its top speed of 21 meters per second (76 km/h;
        47 mph).[13] Designed by the international design firm Gensler and owned by the Shanghai Municipal
        Government,[2] it is the tallest of the world's first triple-adjacent supertall buildings in Pudong, the other
        two being the Jin Mao Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Center. Its tiered construction, designed for high
        energy efficiency, provides nine separate zones divided between office, retail and leisure use.[5][7][14] The
        US-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat cites it as "one of the most sustainably advanced tall
        buildings in the world."[15]</b></p>
