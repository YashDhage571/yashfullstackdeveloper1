        <p><b>The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight,
                        and
                        officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek
                        goddess of
                        victory.[8] Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well as Nike Golf, Nike Pro,
                        Nike+, Nike
                        Blazers,
                        Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, Nike CR7,[9] and subsidiaries
                        including Air
                        Jordan and Converse (brand). Nike also owned Bauer Hockey from 1995 to 2008, and previously
                        owned Cole Haan,
                        Umbro, and Hurley International.[10] In addition to manufacturing sportswear and equipment, the
                        company
                        operates
                        retail stores under the Niketown name. Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams
                        around the
                        world, with the highly recognized trademarks of "Just Do It" and the Swoosh logo.</b></p>

        <p><b>The Nike Swoosh corporate trademark was created in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson while she was a graphic design
                        student at Portland State University. Davidson started as a journalism major but switched to
                        design after
                        taking
                        a design course to "fill an empty elective."[4] She attained a bachelor's in graphic design in
                        1971.[5] It
                        was
                        here that she met Phil Knight, who was at the time teaching accounting classes at the
                        university. Knight had
                        overheard that Davidson was in search of extra funds for her to take oil painting classes, so he
                        offered to
                        pay
                        Davidson to do some freelance work for his company, then named Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS). Knight
                        offered to
                        pay
                        Davidson $2 per hour (equivalent to $15 per hour in 2023) for the work that she completed.[6]
                        For seven
                        years
                        after its founding in 1964, BRS primarily imported Onitsuka Tiger brand running shoes from
                        Japan. In 1971,
                        Knight decided to launch his own brand of shoes, which would first appear as cleated shoes for
                        football or
                        soccer, and had a factory in Mexico ready to make the shoes.</b></p>

        <p><b>Puma is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear,
                        apparel, and accessories, headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third
                        largest
                        sportswear manufacturer in the world.[6] The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler
                        (1898–1974). In
                        1924,
                        Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler
                        Schuhfabrik
                        ('Dassler
                        Brothers Shoe Factory'). The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until they
                        agreed to split
                        in
                        1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma. Following the split, Rudolf originally
                        registered the
                        newly established company as Ruda (derived from Rudolf Dassler, as Adidas was based on Adi
                        Dassler), but
                        later
                        changed the name to Puma. Puma's earliest logo consisted of a square and beast jumping through a
                        D, which
                        was
                        registered, along with the company's name, in 1948. Puma's shoe and clothing designs feature the
                        Puma logo
                        and
                        the distinctive "Formstrip" which was introduced in 1958.[7]</p></b>

        <P><b>In July 1924, Rudolf and his younger brother, Adolf, nicknamed "Adi", founded a shoe factory. They named
                        the
                        new
                        business "Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik" (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory) which was the only
                        business at the
                        time
                        that manufactured sports shoes.[9] The pair started their venture in their mother's laundry. At
                        the time,
                        electricity supplies in the town were unreliable, and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal
                        power from a
                        stationary bicycle to run their equipment.[10] In 1927, they moved into a separate building.</b>
