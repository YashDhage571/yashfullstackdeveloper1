    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger;"><b>Based on the Lamborghini Aventador, the Sián FKP 37 shares its engine with the SVJ
            variant of the Aventador,
            but an electric motor integrated into the gearbox adds another 25 kW (34 PS; 34 hp) to the power output.
            Other modifications to the engine include the addition of titanium intake valves, a reconfigured ECU and a
            new exhaust system raising the power output to 576 kW (784 PS; 773 hp). The total power output is 602 kW
            (818 PS; 807 hp), making the Sián the most powerful production Lamborghini. The engine is connected to a
            7-speed automated manual transmission[5] and the car employs an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive
            system with a rear mechanical self-locking differential for improved handling.[6]</b></p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger;"><b>The power for the electric motor is stored in a supercapacitor unit instead of
            conventional lithium-ion
            batteries. The supercapacitor unit is integrated with the electric motor into the gearbox for a better
            weight distribution. A supercapacitor was chosen as it provides three times the power of a conventional                 
            lithium-ion battery of the same weight. The unit installed in the car is an evolution of the Aventador's
            starter motor and can store ten times more power than the unit it is based on. A regenerative braking system
            helps generate enough energy to recharge the supercapacitors. The electric motor counters the effect of
            deceleration and provides a power boost to the driver at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph). The motor supports
            low-speed manoeuvres such as parking and reversing.[7][8]</b></p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger;"><b>The Bugatti Centodieci (Italian for "110")[3] is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by French
            automotive manufacturer Bugatti. The car is a homage to the Bugatti EB 110 and a celebration of the Bugatti
            marque's 110th birthday. It was revealed on 16 August 2019 at "The Quail – A Motorsports Gathering" in
            California, United States.[4] The Centodieci is 20 kg lighter than the Bugatti Chiron, and has an 8,000 cc
            (8.0 L; 488.2 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, rated at 1,176 kW (1,600 PS; 1,578 hp) at 7,000 rpm.
            Production of the Centodieci was limited to 10 units priced at €8 million (approximately $10 million at the
            2019 exchange rate) each.[5][6][7]</b></p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger;"><b>Based on the Chiron, the car takes design cues from the EB 110 such as the five round air intakes which
            resemble a diamond and the wedge shaped design language. A small horse shoe radiator grille present below
            the headlamps further harks back to the EB 110. Narrow headlights with LED daytime running function and
            sharp grooves are used to create an aggressive appearance. The rear consists of eight tail lights along with
            matt-black quad exhaust pipes placed on either side of a large diffuser, complete with an underbody spoiler
            and a fixed overhanging rear wing. Due to the use of computer assisted 3D design techniques and the use of
            Virtual Reality technology, the design team was able to complete the design of the Centodieci in six
            months.[8][9][1] Compared to the Chiron, the Centodieci is fitted with an additional air intake near the oil
            cooler and an engine bay cover manufactured from glass.[10]</b></p>
